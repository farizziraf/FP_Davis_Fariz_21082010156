## Introduction

### Personal Introduction
Hello, my name is Fariz with NPM: 21082010156. This project is part of my Tugas Besar (major assignment) for the Data Visualization course, Par B. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my skills in data handling, scraping, and visualization using Python.

### Project Introduction
This project focuses on data visualization using Python. It involves two main tasks:
1. Visualizing the AdventureWork dataset.
2. Scraping and visualizing data from the IMDB Top 250 movies list.

## Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:
.
├── dataset
│   ├── imdbscrap.csv
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md

## Requirements
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Gtts
- Mysql-connector-python

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/farizziraf/FP_Davis_Fariz_21082010156.git
    ```

2. Change to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd FP_Davis_Fariz_21082010156
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the project:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Datasets
- **AdventureWork Dataset:** This dataset contains fictional business data for a bike manufacturing company.
- **IMDB Top 250 Movies:** This dataset contains data scraped from the [IMDB website](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?sort=popularity%2Casc), listing the top 250 movies.

## Streamlit Dashboard
The Streamlit dashboard contains visualizations of both the AdventureWork dataset and the IMDB Top 250 Movies data. Each dataset has visualization segments including:
- Comparison
- Relationship
- Composition
- Distribution

You can view the Streamlit dashboard for this project at the following link:

Each segment includes explanations related to the visualizations, along with a text-to-speech feature that reads out the explanations.
